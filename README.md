Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1960s)
In the 1960s, the rapid growth of computer hardware outpaced the ability of developers to create reliable and efficient software. This period, known as the "software crisis," was characterized by projects running over budget, missing deadlines, and producing low-quality software. The term "software engineering" was coined at the 1968 NATO Conference to emphasize the need for a disciplined, engineering-based approach to software development.

This milestone marked the formal recognition of software development as an engineering discipline. It led to the development of structured programming, modular design, and the establishment of methodologies to manage complexity and improve software quality.

- The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged as a paradigm shift in software development, emphasizing the use of objects, classes, and inheritance to model real-world entities and relationships. Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java popularized OOP, enabling developers to build more modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems.

Object Oriented Programming revolutionized software design by promoting concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. It became the foundation for modern software development practices and influenced the design of many programming languages and frameworks.

- The Agile Manifesto and the Shift to Iterative Development (2001)
In 2001, a group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized values such as customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software incrementally. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, replaced traditional waterfall approaches, focusing on iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability.

Agile transformed how software projects were managed, making development more flexible and responsive to changing requirements. It improved team collaboration, reduced time-to-market, and increased customer satisfaction. Agile remains a dominant approach in software engineering today.

- The Advent of Open Source Software (1990s-Present): The rise of open-source software, led by projects like Linux and the GNU Project, democratized software development and fostered collaboration across global communities.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements Gathering and Analysis
Understand and document what the software needs to achieve.

- System Design
Create a blueprint for the software system.

- Implementation (Coding)
Translate the design into executable code.

- Testing
Ensure the software meets requirements and is free of defects.

- Deployment
Release the software for use in its intended environment.

- Maintenance
Ensure the software remains functional, efficient, and relevant over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance is completed before moving to the next whereas Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on delivering small, functional increments of the software in short cycles sometimes known as sprints.

- Waterfall methodology emphasizes thorough planning and documentation upfront whereas Agile methodology emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback.

- An example scenario where waterfall methodology is appropriate is building a payroll system for a company with fixed, well-documented requirements and building a startup's minimum viable product (MVP) to test a new business idea quickly is appropriate for an agile methodology.
